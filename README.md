Online tool that lets you test a webpage and detects **performance** and **front-end code quality** issues.

[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/gmetais/YellowLabTools.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/gmetais/YellowLabTools) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gmetais/YellowLabTools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gmetais/YellowLabTools)


### Access the tool here: [http://yellowlab.tools](http://yellowlab.tools)


## How it works

The tool loads the given URL via [PhantomasJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (a headless browser) and collects various metrics and statistics with the help of [Phantomas](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas). These metrics are categorized and transformed into scores. It also gives in-depth details so developpers can correct the detected issues.

By the way, it's free because we are geeks, not businessmen. All we want is a ★ on GitHub. It will boost our motivation to add more awesome features!!!
